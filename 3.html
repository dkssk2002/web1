        <a href="http://www.tcpschool.com/javascript/js_intro_basic" target="_blank" title="JavaScript specification">JavaScript</a> is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.

        Be not afraid of greatness.
        Some are born great,
        some achieve greatness,
        and others have greatness thrust upon them.
